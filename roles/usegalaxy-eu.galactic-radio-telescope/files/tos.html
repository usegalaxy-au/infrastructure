<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<h2>Use of Service</h2>

The Galactic Radio Telescope is a free, public, Internet accessible resource
(the "Service"). Data transfer is encrypted. Data storage is not encrypted.
All data uploaded to the Service, primarily job run logs but also job metrics
and any other information you choose to upload to the service, is completely
public.

If there are restrictions on your job metadata may be stored and used, please
consult your local institutional review board or the project principal
investigator before uploading it to any public site, including this Service.
Your access to the service may be revoked at any time for reasons deemed
necessary by the operators of the Service.

You acknowledge that you are responsible for compliance of all of your data
processing activities carried out on the Galaxy Service with applicable laws
and regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany, the European Union as well
as any laws or regulations of other legislations or any other restrictions that
might be applicable due to the provenance, intended use, legal ownership of or
any licensing or other legal restrictions imposed on the data being processed.

You are strictly prohibited from making use of the Service for the storage or
processing of any Personal Data or Sensitive Personal Data as defined by the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including but not
limited to potentially personally identifying medical data.

<h2>Accounts and Service Limitations</h2>

You may choose to register an account with the Service. Your registration data
is only used for authentication to the service. The operators of the Service
will not provide your registration data to any third party unless required to
do so by law. Your access to the Service is provided under the condition that
you abide by any published quotas on data storage, job submissions, or any
other limitations placed on the public Service. Attempts to subvert these
limits by creating multiple accounts or through any other method may result in
termination of all associated accounts.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

The Service is provided to you on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this service agreement.

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t, Freiburg
im Breisgau or any other entity which provides resources for the Service be
liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character arising as a result of the use of this Service
including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable
law prohibits such limitation.
